# ZPLC - ZPL Configuration

ZPLC uses TOML syntax.  Work in progress.



## Layout

Suggest layout within the TOML file:

* nodes
* trusted_services
* bootstrap
* protocols
* services


## Nodes

Only one node is supported currently in a ZPRnet.  Syntax:

```toml
[nodes.<NODEID>]
provider = [["<KEY>", "<VALUE>"]]
zpr_address = "fd5a..."
```
* `provider` - The set of attributes required in order to provide the node "service". These
attributes cannot come from an external service they must be "built in".  Typically the
only attribute you can use here is `device.zpr.adapter.cn` which is the `CN` value from
the nodes Noise certificate.
* `zpr_address` - IPv6 ZPRnet address for the node. Node must be preconfigured with this
same address.

### Topology

If there are multiple nodes you need to define their substrate addresses. We support multiple
substrate addresses per node. Each address is specified in `HOST:PORT` format and is tied
to an identifier.  In the example below the identifier is `i0`.


```toml
[nodes.<NODEID>]
provider = [[]]
#...

[nodes.<NODEID>.substrate_addrs]
i0 = "10.0.0.1:5000"
```

To connect nodes you must specific `links` in the zplc file.

```toml
[links.<LINKID>]
attributes = [["zpr.cost", "1"]] # this is the default
peers = [ { node = "<NODEID>" },
          { node = "<NODEID>" } ]
```

If a node has multiple substrate addresses then reference the substrate address name
in the peers list, eg:

```toml
[links.<LINKID>]
attributes = [["zpr.cost", "1"]] # this is the default
peers = [ { node = "<NODEID>" },
          { node = "<NODEID>", interface = "i3" } ]
```

### Link attributes

Link attributes are what a ZPL `over` clause matches against, eg
`allow red users to access database over secure, location:usa links.`

An entry is either a key/value pair or a **tag**. A tag is written with a `#`
prefix and an empty value, the same spelling used by `returns_attributes`:

```toml
[links.<LINKID>]
attributes = [["zpr.cost", "1"],      # key/value
              ["location", "usa"],    # key/value
              ["#secure", ""]]        # tag
```

Giving a `#`-prefixed key a non-empty value is an error.

Because ZPL and ZPLC are always compiled together, the compiler can check an `over`
clause against the topology. Attribute names and values are treated differently:

- An `over` clause naming a link attribute that **no configured link carries** is an
  **error**. Such a statement could never match anything.
- An `over` clause naming a **value** that no configured link carries — while the
  attribute itself does exist — is a **warning** (`location:use` where the configured
  values are `usa` and `eu`). This catches typos without failing the build, since link
  values are topology data a later configuration edit may legitimately introduce, and
  value matching is ultimately the visa service's job at enforcement time. Compile with
  `--werror` to make it fatal.

Tags carry no value, so only the attribute check applies to them.


## Trusted Services

The trusted services block declares where actor attributes come from: which API the
visa service uses to reach the service, and which attributes it vouches for.

Syntax:

```toml
  [trusted_services.<TSNAME>]
  api = "file"            # or "oidc" or "zpr-attr/1"
  returns_attributes = []
  expiration_seconds = 0
  # ...plus the properties specific to the chosen api (see below)
```

The **TSNAME** of `default` is special and is used to check the adapter CN values.
It is responsible for the property: `device.zpr.adapter.cn`.  The default
service takes no `api`, and its only property is `cert_path`, which should be set to the
certificate of the authority which has signed the NOISE certs given to the adapters.

```toml
[trusted_services.default]
cert_path = "path/to/ca/cert.pem"
```


If you omit `trusted_services.default` then certificates will not be checked.

For non default trusted services, the common field meanings are:

* `api` - **Required.** Configures how the visa service uses the trusted service. Valid
  values are:
  * `file` - A file-backed attribute source offered by the visa service itself, with no
     network presence. The visa service loads the attributes from a local `<TSNAME>.json`
     file at runtime. See *File Trusted Services* below.
  * `oidc` - An OpenID Connect identity provider (e.g. Google). The adapter talks to the
     provider directly; the visa service only needs the provider's JWKS to verify tokens.
     See *OIDC Trusted Services* below.
  * `zpr-attr/1` - A networked attribute service the visa service queries over HTTPS.
     See *Attribute Services (zpr-attr/1)* below.

  Any other value is a configuration error.
* `returns_attributes` - List of attribute keys returned by the service mapped to
  ZPL attribute names.
* `expiration_seconds` - Optional lifetime (in seconds) of the attributes this service vouches
  for. Accepted on `file`, `oidc`, and `zpr-attr/1` services (required and
  positive for `oidc` and `zpr-attr/1`); rejected on `default`. Must be a
  non-negative integer that fits in a 32-bit unsigned value. Omitted or `0` means the visa
  service selects the lifetime at runtime (from the service or its own default).

Every trusted-service ID (the `<TSNAME>`) must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`. For a `file` service this
ID is also the filename stem — the visa service loads attributes from `<TSNAME>.json`.

No trusted service has a ZPR network presence of its own: a `file` service is offered by
the visa service itself, and `oidc` and `zpr-attr/1` services are reached over ordinary IP
(an `oidc` service may name an ordinary on-net service as its JWKS proxy; see below).
The compiler therefore weaves every trusted service with no endpoints and no communication
policy, and the network-service properties `provider`, `client`, `cert_path` and `prefix`
are rejected on every API.

### File Trusted Services

A `file` trusted service supplies actor attributes from a local JSON file loaded by the visa
service rather than over the network. Declare only `returns_attributes` (at least one mapping)
and, optionally, `expiration_seconds`:

```toml
[trusted_services.attrfile]
api = "file"
returns_attributes = ["hair_color -> user.hair_color", "lazy -> #user.lazy"]
expiration_seconds = 3600
```

Because a file service has no network presence, the `service`, `client`, `cert_path`, `provider`,
and `identity_attributes` properties are **not** allowed. The compiler weaves it as a service
offered by the visa service CN (`vs.zpr`) with no endpoints and no communication policy. The
attribute mappings use the same `->` syntax (and single / `{}` multi / `#` tag forms) as any other
trusted service (see *Attributes* below).

### OIDC Trusted Services

An `oidc` trusted service declares an OpenID Connect identity provider (such as Google)
as an attribute source. The adapter performs the OIDC flow with the provider directly;
the visa service only verifies the resulting ID tokens against the provider's JWKS.

```toml
[trusted_services.google]
api = "oidc"
issuer = "https://accounts.google.com"
jwks_uri = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
client_id = "my-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
allowed_domains = ["example.com"]
expiration_seconds = 3600
service = "google-jwks"
returns_attributes = ["sub -> user.sub", "email -> user.email"]
identity_attributes = ["sub"]
```

Properties:

* `issuer` - **Required.** The provider's issuer URL as it appears in its tokens. Must be
  an `https://` URL with no query string or fragment.
* `jwks_uri` - **Required.** The provider's JWKS endpoint, from which the visa service
  fetches the token-signing keys. Must be `https://`.
* `client_id` - **Required.** The OAuth client ID registered with the provider; must be
  non-empty.
* `client_secret` - Optional OAuth client secret, for providers that require one.
* `scopes` - Optional list of OAuth scopes to request. Defaults to
  `["openid", "email", "profile"]`. If set, it must include `"openid"`.
* `allowed_domains` - **Required**, non-empty. Account domains accepted from this
  provider. Use `["*"]` to accept any account.
* `seed_jwks` - Optional path to a local JWKS file used to seed key material at compile
  time (resolved relative to the `.zplc` file).
* `expiration_seconds` - **Required** for `oidc`, and must be positive: the lifetime of
  the attributes this provider vouches for.
* `max_auth_age_seconds` - Optional maximum age (in seconds) of the user's
  authentication before re-authentication is required — the session ceiling. Must be a
  non-negative integer that fits in a 32-bit unsigned value. Defaults to `0` (no limit),
  but any **nonzero** value must be at least `expiration_seconds`: a ceiling below the
  credential lifetime would let a credential outlive the session that authorized it, and
  the compiler rejects it with `max_auth_age_seconds must be >= expiration_seconds`.
* `allow_offline_access` - Optional boolean, default `false`. Whether to request
  offline access (refresh tokens) from the provider. Setting it to `true` **requires a
  nonzero `max_auth_age_seconds`**: a refresh token with no session ceiling could renew
  forever, so the compiler rejects the combination with `allow_offline_access requires
  max_auth_age_seconds (the session ceiling)`.
* `returns_attributes` - **Required**, at least one mapping, using the same `->` syntax
  as any other trusted service. The `zpr.` sub-namespace remains reserved.
* `identity_attributes` - **Required** and must be exactly `["sub"]` — the OIDC subject
  is the only stable identity. In particular, `"email"` is rejected as an identity
  attribute because addresses are mutable and reusable.
* `service` - Optional, as for other trusted services. If omitted, the compiler warns:
  without a declared service the visa service will need direct internet egress to reach
  the `jwks_uri`.

Because the adapter talks to the provider directly and TLS to the provider is verified
against system roots, the `client`, `provider`, `cert_path`, and `prefix` properties are
**not** allowed on an `oidc` trusted service. The `default` trusted service cannot use
`api = "oidc"`.

### Attribute Services (zpr-attr/1)

A `zpr-attr/1` trusted service declares a networked attribute service: an HTTPS API the
visa service queries for actor attributes, keyed on identities vended by other trusted
services (the same decorating-store role as `api = "file"`, but over the network). The
wire protocol is specified in `zl-zpr-dev-context/docs/ATTRIBUTE_SERVICE.md`.

```toml
[trusted_services.zipline]
api = "zpr-attr/1"
url = "https://attrs.zipline.example/tenant-7"    # base of the API; https required
ca_cert_path = "zipline-ca.pem"                   # optional: PEM, embedded in the policy
timeout_seconds = 5                               # optional: 1..=30, default 5
expiration_seconds = 3600                         # required: how long returned attributes live
returns_attributes = [
  "dept -> user.dept",             # single-valued
  "roles -> user.role{}",          # multi-valued
  "contractor -> #user.contractor" # tag
]
```

Properties:

* `url` - **Required.** The base URL of the service's API. Must be `https://` with a
  host and no query string or fragment. It may carry a path prefix; the visa service
  appends `/query` and `/schema`. A trailing slash is normalised away.
* `ca_cert_path` - Optional path, relative to the `.zplc` file, of a PEM file holding
  one or more `CERTIFICATE` blocks. Its **contents** are embedded in the compiled
  policy, so the pin is signed along with everything else. When present it is
  **exclusive**: the visa service trusts only these roots for this service and disables
  the built-in system roots. Absent means system roots.
* `timeout_seconds` - Optional whole-request timeout the visa service applies to every
  call. An integer from 1 to 30; defaults to 5.
* `expiration_seconds` - **Required** and must be positive: the default lifetime of
  every attribute returned, and the ceiling on any lifetime the service asks for. The
  visa service enforces a 60-second floor at runtime.
* `returns_attributes` - **Required**, at least one mapping, using the same `->` syntax
  as any other trusted service. The `zpr.` sub-namespace remains reserved.

An attribute service is a decorating store keyed on other services' identities, so
`identity_attributes` is **not** allowed (the same rule as `api = "file"`). The
`provider`, `client`, `cert_path`, and `prefix` properties are not allowed
either. **`service` is reserved**: it will one day name a ZPR service through which the
visa service reaches an on-net attribute service; in `zpr-attr/1` it is rejected, and
reaching the service over ordinary IP is the only mode. The `default` trusted service
cannot use `api = "zpr-attr/1"`.

Like a `file` service, an attribute service is woven with no endpoints and no
communication policy, is retained when a policy statement references one of its
attributes, and is pruned otherwise.

### Attributes

An attribute is of the form: `<NAMESPACE>.<ATTR_KEY>`.  There may be additional periods
in the `<ATTR_KEY>` value.

Every attribute must be in one of the ZPR namespaces: "device", "user", or "service".

Valid attribute examples:
* `user.id`
* `device.tmp.key_hash`
* `service.type`

Attributes from services may be single value, multi value, or tags.  An attribute list
(eg, `returns_attributes` or `identity_attributes`) is a list of strings.  The type of
the attribute is set as:

* **Single Value** - Just a plain string, eg `"user.clearance"`.
* **Multi Value** - Add a '{}' to the end, eg `"user.role{}"`.
* **Tag** - Prefixed with a hash mark (`#`), eg `"#device.secure`.

The type changes how two requirements on the same attribute combine. When one statement
requires two values of a **multi-valued** attribute -- through a class plus an attribute, a
subclass, or a trailing `on` clause -- the compiler requires all of the values, the same as
writing the set form `user.role:{admin,operator}`. When it requires two different values of a
**single-valued** attribute, compilation fails with `conflicting values for attribute`.

When specifying the `returns_attributes` use a map format with an arrow '->':


```toml
returns_attributes = [
  "tint -> device.tint",
  "color -> user.color",
  "govt -> #user.government",
  "sub -> user.id",
  "roles -> user.role{}"
]
```

And then for `identity_attributes` (only an `oidc` service declares them) make sure to
use the service name (not the ZPL name).  For example, given the above returns attributes:

```toml
identity_attributes = [ "sub" ]
```


## Bootstrap

The boostrap section maps a `CN` value (from noise keys) to a cooresponding public
RSA key file.  When adapters connect with these `CN` values, they can perform "self authentication"
which ends up having the visa service check that the adapter is using the correct private
key.

Bootstrap is required for services that need to connect before there are trusted services
connected.

Syntax:

```toml
[boostrap]
"some.cn.value.here" = "path-to-rsa-pub-key.pem"
```


## Protocols

Use protocols blocks to define protocols that are needed to access your services.

Syntax:
```toml
[protocols.<NAME>]
l4protocol = "TCP"
port = 80

# or if using ICMP
[protocols.ping]
l4protocol = "ICMP4"
icmp_type = "request-response"
icmp_codes = [0, 8]
```

* `protocols.<NAME>` - The NAME here is used later in `services` blocks to reference
the protocol.
* `l4protocol` - Layer 4 protocol name. One of 'TCP', 'UDP', 'ICMPV6', or 'ICMP' (or 'ICMP4').
* `port` - TCP/UDP port(s). Either a single port number (`port = 80`) or a string
holding a comma-separated list of port numbers and inclusive `LOW-HIGH` ranges, eg
`port = "443, 4343, 8000-8010"`. Each entry becomes its own scope in the compiled
policy, and the visa service matches a flow on any one of them.
* `icmp_type` - Required for the ICMP familty of protocols, possible values are: `request-response` or `oneshot`.
* `icmp_codes` - Is a list of integers.  For `request-response` this is a tuple of
(request-code, response-code).  For `oneshot` this is one or more allowed ICMP codes.



## Services

A service must be defined in the configuration for every service that is
declared in the policy file.  The basic format is:

```toml
[service.<NAME>]
protocol = "" # required
```

The `<NAME>` must match a name in the ZPL policy file.  The `protocol` must match a
protocol block defined elsewhere in the configuration.

Since it is typical to have a protocol like `HTTPS` but then have instances that
use many different ports, it is possible to override some aspects of a protocol in
the service definition, for example:

```toml
[protocols.webtls]
l4protocol = "TCP"
port = 443

[services.WebService]
protocol = "webtls"
port = 3030
```

The service's `port` accepts the same list and range forms as a protocol's, and
replaces the protocol's ports rather than adding to them. So a service that
listens on both 443 and 4343 is:

```toml
[services.WebService]
protocol = "webtls"
port = "443, 4343"
```

To associate a service with an actor you need provider attributes. These can
come from the ZPL, but you can also put them in the configuration.  Eg,

```toml
[service.WebService]
protocol = "http"
port = 80
provider = [[ "device.zpr.adapter.cn", "foo.blah"]]
```

If you need a static address for a service, do NOT put the address in the
policy — an authored `["zpr.addr", ...]` provider attribute is a compile
error. Instead, declare a trusted service that returns `device.zpr_addr` for
the adapter (any API works; `file` is the minimum), keyed on an authenticated
attribute such as the adapter CN:

```toml
[trusted_services.addresses]
api = "file"
returns_attributes = ["zpr_addr -> device.zpr_addr"]
expiration_seconds = 3600
```

with a store file (`<file_ts_dir>/addresses.json`, where `file_ts_dir`
defaults to the directory of the visa service's `vs.toml`):

```json
{ "device.zpr.adapter.cn": { "foo.blah": { "zpr_addr": ["fd5a:5052:2020::19"] } } }
```

The adapter that brings up a static TUN keeps the matching `zpr_addr` in its
own config file; the visa service checks that the granted address and the
adapter's requested address agree. Note that a node's static address is
different: it is topology, set with `zpr_address` in the node's `[nodes.X]`
block, not granted.
